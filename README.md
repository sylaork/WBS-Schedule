I recently had the opportunity to plan a specialized medical app project using Microsoft Project. This endeavor was both challenging and rewarding as it involved creating a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) based on PRINCE2 and integrating Scrum methodology for software development.

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what I worked on:

WBS Customization: I started with a generic template, identified and resolved inconsistencies, and structured it across directing, management, and delivery levels.
Scheduling and Estimation: Ensured accurate work and duration estimates, set dependencies, and incorporated buffers for real-world flexibility.
Resource Allocation: Optimized resource leveling to balance workload while staying within our project constraints of â‚¬600K and 8 months.
Milestones and Deliverables: Planned three key releasesâ€”Alpha, Beta, and General Availabilityâ€”while maintaining clear timelines and deliverables.
This project reinforced the importance of meticulous planning, adaptability, and leveraging tools like MS Project to align vision with execution.

Iâ€™m proud of how this plan evolved, and Iâ€™d love to connect with others in the field to share insights and learn from your experiences. Feel free to reach out or share your thoughts below! ðŸ˜Š
